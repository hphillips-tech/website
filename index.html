                <p>
                    I am an eighteen year old IT Student, 
                    working towards getting my bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity.
                    I have had a passion of information technology for as long as I have known.

                <p>
                    I started my IT journey by attending a two year course at the 
                    Scioto County Career Technical Center, in the class we learned things like 
                    web development, 3D modeling with blender, and the basics of IT. 
                    I later started a program at the same school to earn my 
                    CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and Server+. 
                    Soon I plan to attend Wester Governor's University to
